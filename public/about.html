<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I hope this message finds you well.
  My name is Ferree, currently an IT student in Canadian College in Vancouver. I’m reaching out to express
  my interest in being a operations assistant at springloaded. With over 2 years of being an admin
  assistant, I am very proficient in using Microsoft softwares such as word, suite, and excel. In my past
  experienced I&#39;ve Answered phone calls and inquiries, did some data entries.
  In my high school days. I&#39;ve studied in National University in the Philippines. Now, I&#39;m studying
  information Technology and add to this I&#39;m studying Udemy on the side for a web development
  certificate to further improve my skills. In my recent job at Tim Hortons, my roles includes baking,
  customer service, barista, cashier. This is what I&#39;ve learned from almost 8 months now. I&#39;ve learned how
  to be humble and did my job with a heart. I&#39;ve learned how to be friends with everyone. It&#39;s hard at first
  but I got used to it. I&#39;ve learned to manage my time well, it&#39;s really about physical work and keeping a
  smile always to keep everyone with a good atmosphere. I also have experience in being an admin
  assistant before, such as doing powerpoints, quickbooks, and microsoft 365.
  I’m applying because soon I’ll be doing my co-op in Information Technology. It needs to be connected to
  my field. Which mostly needs technologies such as, Microsoft Excel, Word, Suite, Firewall, DNS, or
  router connections set ups.
  Thank you so much for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I
  can contribute to your company in more detail. Please feel free to reach out to me at (672) 336-7785 or
